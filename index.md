I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about**Tech Trek**

Tech Trek is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) camp designed to develop interest, excitement, and self-confidence in young women who will enter eighth grade in the fall. It features hands-on activities in STEM-related fields. In the residential camps, all sleeping, eating, instructional and recreational facilities are located on a university campus where camps are held. In 2021 all camps will be virtual.

The very successful California Tech Trek camp, created and implemented by Marie Wolbach at Stanford in 1998 (and grew throughout California), was the model AAUW National used to initiate the 2013 National Tech Trek Program. By 2020, a total of nine states held camps sponsored by AAUW branches. This includes Californiaâ€™s Tech Trek program, held at seven college/university campuses (which host a total of nine camps), and is part of the National program.

The California Tech Trek camps are still run by dedicated California AAUW volunteers and held on the same university campuses; little has changed in the way our camps are managed and deployed. Incorporated into a National program with California as its role model - future Trekkers will continue to have amazing experiences.
